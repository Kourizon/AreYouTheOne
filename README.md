Implementation of the "IDEAL", "RANDOM", and "EDUCATED" algorithms are complete
Change the variables in AYTO.py to record data for different algorithms. Options are ideal_week, random_week, and educated_week. Additionally, you must label your data. Some recommended names are 'ideal', 'random', and 'educated'
This will create and update a csv file to store the data

AYTOgraphs.py will represent the data with certain labels in a histogram. You can change what data it uses by changing the input label
